note: "production" includes data load and transform scripts in addition to the express api. since babel is also used to load and transform data, which is PROD, babel is not really a dev-dependency

new: @babel/plugin-syntax-top-level-await
purpose: IIAFEs not necessary in data load scripts
Babel supports parsing of this feature only, will not transform. 
do not use in the express api
use it in scripts run via:
./node_modules/@babel/node/bin/babel-node.js --plugins @babel/plugin-syntax-top-level-await script.js
ttd: still getting: 
SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word

with babel 7:
npx babel-node --presets=@babel/preset-env --plugins=@babel/plugin-syntax-top-level-await test.mjs
... it's supposed to use .babelrc, so ...
npx babel-node test.mjs
... syntax error, still with both
!!! preset-env only loads finished proposals

heroku:
if a Node version isnâ€™t specified in the engine, the latest Long-Term-Support (currently 12.x) release will be used.
-- already specified 14.x in package.json

GA: https://github.com/actions/setup-node

stage 3 so don't expect it to work without a flag:
node --experimental-repl-await test.mjs
!!! ding, ding, ding
node --harmony-top-level-await test.mjs
node --harmony test.mjs # nope

* using babel-node is all about not depending on the node version on GA and heroku. ... is that an option?

* high memory usage, never for prod ... really? browsers? but check memory usage? I think this is meant for the api server, which I only use presets that can be transformed. plan is to use the cli for running data load scripts. 
* check github actions, heroku allow npx ...

@babel/cli
A required install for using babel
It allows the use of Babel from the terminal and is available as ./node_modules/.bin/babel

@babel/core	
Core Babel functionality. This is a required installation.

@babel/node	
works exactly like the Node.js CLI, with the added benefit of compiling with babel presets and plugins
!!! required for use with *nodemon*

@babel/plugin-transform-runtime	
helps to avoid duplication in the compiled output
@babel/runtime	
This works in conjunction with @babel/plugin-transform-runtime

@babel/preset-env
A collection of plugins that are responsible for carrying out code transformations

@babel/register	
This compiles files on the fly 
!!! and is specified as a requirement during *tests*

considered babel-plugin-root-import, but the config seems cumbersome and risky
* look for tooling or extension to auto-fix relative paths when moving stuff
