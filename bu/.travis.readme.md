
Travis CI is an automated test runner - a tool that runs tests automatically each time you push a commit to GitHub and each time you create a pull request (by showing you if the new code has broken any of the tests)
1. Visit travis-ci.com or travis-ci.org and create an account if you don’t have one. You have to sign up with your GitHub account.
2. Hover over the dropdown arrow next to your profile picture and click on settings.
3. Under Repositories tab click Manage repositories on Github to be redirected to Github.
4. On the GitHub page, scroll down to Repository access and click the checkbox next to Only select repositories.
5. Click the Select repositories dropdown and find the express-api-template repo. Click it to add it to the list of repositories you want to add to travis-ci.
6. Click Approve and install and wait to be redirected back to travis-ci.



7. At the top of the repo page, close to the repo name, click on the build unknown icon. From the Status Image modal, select markdown from the format dropdown.
8. Copy the resulting code and paste it in your README.md file.
9.  On the project page, click on More options > Settings. Under Environment Variables section, add the TEST_ENV_VARIABLE env variable. When entering its value, be sure to have it within double quotes like this "Environment variable is coming across."
10. Create .travis.yml file at the root of your project and paste in the below code (We’ll set the value of CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID in the Code Climate section).

First, we tell Travis to run our test with Node.js, then set the CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID global environment variable (we’ll get to this in the Code Climate section). In the matrix section, we tell Travis to run our tests with Node.js **v12**. We also want to cache the node_modules/ directory so it doesn’t have to be regenerated every time.

We install our dependencies using the yarn command which is a shorthand for yarn install. The before_script and after_script commands are used to upload coverage results to codeclimate. We’ll configure codeclimate shortly. After yarn test runs successfully, we want to also run yarn coverage which will upload our coverage report to coveralls.io.

CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID comes from codeclimate.com: Under Codebase Summary, click on Test Coverage. Under the Test coverage menu, copy the TEST REPORTER ID and paste it in your .travis.yml as the value of CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID. It’s important to note that there are two ways of configuring maintainability checks. There are the default settings that are applied to every repo, but if you like, you could provide a .codeclimate.yml file at the root of your project. Otherwise, you're using the default settings, which are found under the Maintainability tab of the repo settings page.
